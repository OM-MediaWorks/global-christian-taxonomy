# Global Christian Taxonomy

This is a taxonomy / category system for usage by Christian media publishers and consumers.

Goals for the long term:

- Available in many languages
- Making it possible to search for Christian media over many sources and being able to use a category that filters the media
  - See [bundled.media](https://bundled.media/stream) for something that uses this taxonomy (might only work in Chrome at the moment)
- Nested categories, a hierarchy of categories
- Available as RDF, JSON and Excel 
- Open Source widgets for CMS'es
- Each category to have: 
  - an icon (see [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/))
  - an image that people can use as a background preferable from Unsplash.
  - a description when to use it
  - aliasses & synonyms
  - References to other systems via [owl:sameAs](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def)
- A group of organizations that maintain and own this taxonomy (get into contact for joining)

Challenges (and some possible solutions):

- Categories might not translate 100%
  - We could have categories that are siblings in the hierarchy and that have for 70% the same meaning
- How to get media publishers to use this taxonomy?
- The icons and the backgrounds might need to be dependant on the language or the culture
- How to use these taxonomy terms on YouTube or Vimeo? 
  - We could create codes such as GCT:034 which systems than can map to the correct label
  - If we choose this way we need tooling for this

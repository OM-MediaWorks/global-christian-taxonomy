We want to create a Christian standard category system that will be free for all and easily translatable in any language. We want to help the Christian media landscape to apply these categories to the top 10% of all Christian media. 

We will not be able to do this alone. We want to create a group of organisations that will carry this cause.

__We want to help the Christian Media landscape to achieve this, do you want to join us in this cause?__

## Integrations

We want to create easy integration for all kinds of systems. It should be very simple to use this category system in your existing website or media system.

We want to create widgets for systems such as WordPress and Drupal. Selecting the category for a media item should be a simple click.

### How to use on platforms

Each category has an identifier such as `gct:bibles-and-bible-stories`. These identifiers can be used on platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. On systems that you or your organisation control we should of course show the label in your language.

### How to use in systems you own

An integration has to be created that would save the URL such as `https://taxonomy.mediaworks.global/bible-studies` in your database and which would display the translated label when viewing your website.
